# Mail Merge

The program takes a text document containing a name placeholder and a document with a list of names and creates a new letter for every name in the list, replacing the placeholder from the blueprint letter with an actual name. The new letters are stored in Output/ReadyToSend.

The purpose of this exercise was to get familiar with working with files on a basic level, reading from them and writing to them.
