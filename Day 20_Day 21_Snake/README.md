# The Snake Game

The purpose of the project was to get familiar with using inheritance and list slicing in Python.

Move with arrow keys, collect the green square (food) and try to extend the snake as much as possible without crashing into a screen border or the snake's tail.

Play the game [here](https://trinket.io/python/525671f63b?outputOnly=true&runOption=run).
(Disclaimer: for some reason, the "game over" text isn't displayed on Trinket, but the rest should function as intended. It would be best to download the files and run the game locally.)
