# The Snake Game

The purpose of the project was to get familiar with using inheritance and list slicing in Python.

Move with arrow keys, collect the green square (food) and try to extend the snake as much as possible without crashing into a screen border or the snake's tail.

**Update Day 24**: Introduced a high score which gets loaded on game start and saved when a new high score is set. 
The purpose of introducing this was to get familiar with file reading and writing to a file in Python.
Also added handling of closing of the window without throwing an error.

Play the game [here](https://trinket.io/python/525671f63b?outputOnly=true&runOption=run). <br>
(Disclaimer: for some reason, the "game over" text isn't displayed on Trinket, but the rest should function as intended. It would be best to download the files and run the game locally.)

Alternatively, download the project and run the __Snake__.exe file.
