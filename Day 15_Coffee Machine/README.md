# Coffee Machine
The purpose of this project was mostly to get familiar with PyCharm as well as to
incorporate everything I learned during the past two weeks.

The program is still written in a procedural style and there is no error handling.

Coffee Machine is a simple program that:
1. displays the menu
2. asks the user to choose from the menu
3. confirms whether the item can be made or not depending on the available ingredients
4. if the item can be made, asks the user to insert money
5. handles payment
6. outputs the selected coffee and the change (if any)
7. the user can enter "off" to turn off the machine instead of choosing from the menu
8. the user can enter "report" to see how many ingredients and money the machine has instead of choosing from the menu
