The purpose of this project was to get familiar with OOP in Python: 
- creating classes
- creating objects
- initializing objects
- writing and using methods and attributes

The program takes a list of dictionaries with a question-answer pair, iterates through them and asks input from the user. If the user's answer is correct, the score increments. When the program exits the loop (there are no more questions), the final score is displayed.
