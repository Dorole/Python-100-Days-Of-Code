# Turtle Crossing

An imitation of Crossy Road.<br>
Implemented a countdown and multiple levels with progressive difficulty.<br>
Try to move the turtle to the top of the screen without bumping into any "cars".<br>
Each lane releases its cars according to a random pattern set at the start of the game.<br>
The player can only move upwards (with W or Up Arrow).<br>
Complete three levels to clear the game.
