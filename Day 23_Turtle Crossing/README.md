# Turtle Crossing

An imitation of Crossy Road.<br>
Implemented a countdown and multiple levels with progressive difficulty.<br>
Try to move the turtle to the top of the screen without bumping into any "cars".<br>
Each lane releases its cars according to a random pattern set at the start of the game.<br>
The player can only move upwards (with W or Up Arrow).<br>
Complete three levels to clear the game.

Download the project and run _TurtleCrossing_ to try it out.<br>
To restart, exit the window and run the .exe file again. If you exit before either a game-over or a game-cleared flag occurs, an error window will pop up - ignore and close it.
