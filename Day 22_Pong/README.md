# Pong

An imitation of the classic arcade Pong game.<br>
Control the left paddle with W/S and the right paddle with Up/Down arrow keys.<br>
The ball gains speed every time it hits one of the paddles.<br>
Score a point when the opponent misses the ball.<br>
The first player to reach 10 points wins.<br>

Download the project and run __Pong__.exe to play.
(If you exit the game before one of the players reaches 10 points, an error window will pop out. Ignore and close it.)
